Commutation and Automobile,"Vehicle telemetry collection: Build a backend service that collects and stores vehicle operational data such as speed, temperature, or energy-related metrics. The system should handle structured inputs and allow retrieval of recent telemetry information for individual vehicles."
Commutation and Automobile,Secure Authentication & Access Control for Healthcare Systems: Design a security system for a hospital or healthcare platform that protects patient information. The solution should enforce role-based access for patients and staff and handle sensitive actions carefully.
 Smart City and Infrastructure,"Urban Infrastructure Data Portal: Develop a system that manages structured information about city infrastructure assets such as roads, utilities, or public facilities. The system should allow infrastructure records to be created, updated, viewed, and organized, and should provide a basic overview of current infrastructure status within a city."
 Smart City and Infrastructure,"Secure Access & API Protection for Urban Systems: Design a security layer for a city infrastructure management system that controls access to data and system functionality. The solution should define user roles relevant to city operations, enforce access restrictions, and record access-related activity for monitoring or review purposes."
 Medical and Health Care,"Patient Query & Appointment Interface: Develop a user-facing interface for patients to submit healthcare-related queries and request doctor appointments. The solution should emphasize clarity, structured inputs, and ease of use."
 Medical and Health Care,Secure Authentication & Access Control for Healthcare Systems: Design a security system for a hospital or healthcare platform that protects patient information. The solution should enforce role-based access for patients and staff and handle sensitive actions carefully.
Commutation and Automobile,Vehicle Health Evaluation: Create a system that assesses the operational condition of vehicles based on defined rules or data patterns. The solution should classify vehicle health states and make evaluation results accessible for monitoring purposes.
Commutation and Automobile,Alert & Fault Detection: Develop a system that detects vehicle faults or abnormal conditions and generates alerts. The logic for identifying and prioritizing alerts should be defined by the team and clearly explained.
 Smart City and Infrastructure,"Infrastructure Health & Anomaly Analysis: Build a system that evaluates the operational condition of urban infrastructure assets using defined rules, thresholds, or patterns. The solution should identify abnormal conditions, classify asset health states, and present health information in a clear and structured manner."
 Smart City and Infrastructure,Citizen Issue Processing System: Create a backend system for managing citizen-reported city issues such as infrastructure complaints or service disruptions. The system should organize issues by category or location and allow tracking of issue status over time.
 Medical and Health Care,"Inter-Department Workflow Automation: Create a backend system that routes patient queries or requests across hospital departments using defined workflows. The solution should track movement, status, and progress of requests."
 Medical and Health Care,"Administrative Analytics Dashboard: Build a dashboard that provides hospital administrators with insights into operational activity, such as workload distribution or resolution trends, using structured visualizations."
Commutation and Automobile,"Vehicle Maintenance & Service Tracking: Build a system that manages vehicle maintenance and service records. The solution should track routine servicing activities, determine upcoming or overdue maintenance, and maintain a history of service events."
Commutation and Automobile,Fleet Governance & Scheduling: Design a system that manages multiple vehicles across different categories or organizations. The solution should support visibility control and scheduling or prioritization decisions based on vehicle characteristics or defined criteria.
 Smart City and Infrastructure,"Infrastructure Capacity & Utilization Monitoring: Develop a system that monitors how city infrastructure resources are being used relative to their intended capacity. The solution should represent utilization levels for assets or zones and highlight situations such as congestion, overload, or underuse."
 Smart City and Infrastructure,Smart Response & Resource Coordination: Design a decision-support system that assists city administrators or response teams in prioritizing incidents and coordinating resources. The solution should support informed response planning without assuming full automation.
 Medical and Health Care,AI-Based Response Suggestions: Develop a system that assists hospital staff by suggesting draft responses to patient queries. The system should support review and editing rather than fully automated replies.
 Medical and Health Care,Clinical Decision Support: Design a system that provides doctors or clinical staff with rule-based recommendations or warnings based on patient-related information or workflow context.
